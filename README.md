# A space-time simulator for hourly wind and solar energy fields
This GitHub repository contains the code to replicate the study title "A space-time simulator for hourly wind and solar energy fields" by Yash Amonkar (UNC Chapel Hill), David J Farnham (ClimateAI) and Upmanu Lall (Columbia). 
This study has been submitted to Applied Energy (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-energy) for peer review.


Abstract - Spatially distributed renewable electricity generation poses unique risks to power systems, since the aggregate amount of energy produced in any hour depends on the spatial correlation structure of the sources. 
Moreover, the spatial correlation structure can vary with time of day and season, and depend on the state of the large scale climate. 
These features pose a challenge for risk assessment using traditional statistical or machine learning methods. 
A new algorithm based on spatially clustered k-nearest neighbors to capture temporal dynamics of wind and solar fields is presented and applied to data from Texas. 
The algorithm's utility in assessing temporally varying risk of lower than expected target production across the Texas grid is demonstrated.
